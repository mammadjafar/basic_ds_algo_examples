# basic_ds_algo_examples
Implementations for basic data structures and algorithms 
in graph folder we have some basic Graph data stucture example, with 
Minimum spanning tree 
topological order 
breadth first search 
depth first search


NB: in this codes we didn't ponder on encapsulation and other stuff which makes codes clearner etc. 
it's just simple ds&algo implementation.
