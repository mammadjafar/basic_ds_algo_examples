## Implementations for basic data structures and algorithms 
In graph folder we have some basic **Graph** data stucture example, with 
 - Minimum spanning tree 
 - Topological order 
 - Breadth first search 
 - Depth first search


*NB: in this repo we didn't ponder on encapsulation and other stuff which makes code cleaner etc. 
it's just simple ds&algo implementation.*
